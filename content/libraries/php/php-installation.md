# What Do I Need?
To start using PHP, you can:     

* Find a web host with PHP and MySQL support
* Install a web server on your own PC, and then install PHP and MySQL

## Use a Web Host With PHP Support     

If your server has activated support for PHP you do not need to do anything.     
Just create some .php files, place them in your web directory, and the server will automatically parse them for you.    
You do not need to compile anything or install any extra tools.     
Because PHP is free, most web hosts offer PHP support.     

## Set Up PHP on Your Own PC
However, if your server does not support PHP, you must:    

* install a web server
* install PHP
* install a database, such as MySQL
* The official PHP website (PHP.net) has installation instructions for PHP: http://php.net/manual/en/install.php
